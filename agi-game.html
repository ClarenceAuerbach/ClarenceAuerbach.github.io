        <h2>Understanding AGI & Neural Networks</h2>

        <div class="concept">
          <h3>What is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)?</h3>
          <p>Artificial General Intelligence refers to a hypothetical AI system that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a human level or beyond. Unlike narrow AI (which excels at specific tasks), AGI would possess the ability to transfer learning between different domains and solve novel problems without explicit programming.</p>
          <p><span class="highlight">Key Characteristics:</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ability to learn from limited examples (few-shot learning)</li>
            <li>Transfer learning across different domains</li>
            <li>Reasoning and problem-solving in novel situations</li>
            <li>Common sense understanding of the world</li>
            <li>Adaptability and continuous learning</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="concept">
          <h3>Neural Networks: The Foundation</h3>
          <p>Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neurons in the brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that process information and learn patterns from data through a process called backpropagation.</p>
          <p><span class="highlight">Architecture Components:</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Input Layer:</strong> Receives raw data from the environment (images, text, numbers, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden Layers:</strong> Process and transform data through learned weights and activation functions</li>
            <li><strong>Output Layer:</strong> Produces predictions or classifications based on processed information</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="concept">
          <h3>How Learning Works: Backpropagation</h3>
          <p>Backpropagation is the algorithm that enables neural networks to learn. It works in two phases:</p>
          <p><span class="highlight">Forward Pass:</span> Input data flows through the network, and predictions are made.</p>
          <p><span class="highlight">Backward Pass:</span> Errors are calculated and propagated backward through the network, updating weights to reduce future errors.</p>
          <div class="code-block">
for each training iteration:
  1. Forward pass: compute predictions
  2. Calculate loss: compare predictions to expected output
  3. Backward pass: compute gradients
  4. Update weights: adjust by learning rate × gradient
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="concept">
          <h3>Activation Functions</h3>
          <p>Activation functions introduce non-linearity into neural networks, allowing them to learn complex patterns. Without them, stacking layers would be equivalent to a single linear transformation.</p>
          <p><span class="highlight">Common Activation Functions:</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sigmoid:</strong> Squashes values between 0 and 1, used historically in early neural networks</li>
            <li><strong>ReLU:</strong> Returns max(0, x), most popular in modern deep learning</li>
            <li><strong>Tanh:</strong> Squashes values between -1 and 1, helps with gradient flow</li>
            <li><strong>Softmax:</strong> Converts outputs to probability distributions for classification</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="concept">
          <h3>Loss Functions & Optimization</h3>
          <p>Loss functions measure how far predictions are from actual values. The network's goal is to minimize this loss. Different tasks require different loss functions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE):</strong> For regression problems (predicting continuous values)</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Entropy Loss:</strong> For classification problems (categorical predictions)</li>
            <li><strong>Gradient Descent:</strong> The optimization algorithm that updates weights to minimize loss</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="concept">
          <h3>Deep Learning & Representation Learning</h3>
          <p>Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple hidden layers (hence "deep"). Each layer learns progressively more abstract representations of the data.</p>
          <p><span class="highlight">For example, in image recognition:</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Layer 1: Detects edges and basic shapes</li>
            <li>Layer 2: Combines edges into textures</li>
            <li>Layer 3: Recognizes parts (eyes, nose, etc.)</li>
            <li>Layer 4: Identifies high-level concepts (faces, objects)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="concept">
          <h3>The Path to AGI</h3>
          <p>Current AI systems excel at narrow tasks (image recognition, language translation, game playing) but lack the generality of human intelligence. To achieve AGI, we need:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Transfer Learning:</strong> Using knowledge from one domain to improve learning in another</li>
            <li><strong>Few-Shot Learning:</strong> Learning from very few examples, as humans do</li>
            <li><strong>Reasoning & Planning:</strong> Combining learned patterns with logical reasoning</li>
            <li><strong>Multimodal Learning:</strong> Understanding and connecting information from different sources (vision, language, audio)</li>
            <li><strong>Continual Learning:</strong> Learning continuously without forgetting previous knowledge</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="concept">
          <h3>Current Challenges & Opportunities</h3>
          <p><span class="highlight">Challenges:</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Scalability: Training large models requires massive computational resources</li>
            <li>Data Efficiency: Current systems need enormous amounts of data</li>
            <li>Interpretability: Understanding why neural networks make certain decisions</li>
            <li>Safety & Alignment: Ensuring AGI systems behave according to human values</li>
          </ul>
          <p><span class="highlight">Opportunities:</span></p>

            <li>Automating dangerous and repetitive tasks</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <h3>The Future of AI</h3>
          <p>The field is rapidly evolving. Recent advances include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Transformer Models:</strong> State-of-the-art in NLP and vision (GPT, BERT, ViT)</li>
